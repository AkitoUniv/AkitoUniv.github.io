        <h1>It all started with a simple stall..</h1>
        <p>
            The year 2010 when first founded by Melyn Kinkito as a scramble stall where she 
            sells shakes and flavored shaved ice far from her home. Many people liked it 
            enough that after a year (2011), she tried selling Halo-halo and moved the stall in 
            front of her house. As days go, many people in West Crame want to eat street 
            foods but none where selling permanently in the barangay as the street food 
            stalls are always roaming to other places. 
        </p>

        <p>
            2 years gone by (2013), she buys a tiny gas tank with a built-in stove, some bags 
            of fish balls, squid balls, chicken balls, and kikiam. This was a hit in the barangay 
            and many bought from the stall. As more people buy, the more materials and food she 
            needs to add to the list. The stall was getting old and broken but a good thing is, 
            in the Year 2015 where the family rent a house in front, and Melyn moved the store.
        </p>

        <h1>It gets bigger and popular... but it needed something.</h1>
        <p>
            The store become so popular that using the same street foods over and over will be bad 
            in the long run. She thought of what if she sold siomai like the stalls in malls that 
            taste great with garlic, soy sauce, and lime and not without gulaman as well. As expected, 
            it turned out one of the best sellers that most jeepney drivers buy gulaman to remove their 
            thirst, and some people pre-order a large amount for their occasions.
        </p>

        <p>
            The store grew and competitors comes, since Melyn was the first ever permanent store of 
            street food in the barangay, many copied her success during the pandemic because most jobs 
            closed down. And the story goes on...
