                        It is derived from the Chinese Shumai. It is considered a light meal, similar to the Chinese Dim Sum. 
                        It is traditionally made from pork but is frequently substituted with tenggiri (spanish mackerel), 
                        as many Indonesians observe the halal dietary law. 
                        Sometimes other types of seafood such as tuna, mackerel, and prawn also can be used to make siomay. 
                        Other complements to siomay include steamed cabbage, potatoes, bitter gourd, boiled egg, and tofu. 
                        Siomai is often cut into bite size pieces and topped with peanut sauce, sweet soy sauce, 
                        chili sauce and a dash of lime juice.
